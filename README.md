## Ruby Refresher

A Ruby refresher containing 41 questions of varying difficulty.

To run the specs, just run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
~~~

**Quick tip**: to run a single example, change `it` to `fit` on that example, then run

~~~
$ rspec spec/questions_spec.rb --tag focus
~~~

Also, don't spend the whole weekend on this. Try and do the bulk of them today, revisit it a bit this weekend if you want. Spend the weekend consolidating the stuff we've covered in JS :smile:

### Tips

* Use the ruby docs http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/String.html
* Try and break down the problems into smaller chunks. For e.g. if you google "How to select elements in an array that start with a", you won't have much luck. Try and find out a) how to select certain elements in an array, b) how to test if a string starts with an 'a'
